/*
    MONGOOSE:-

    - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library 
    for Node.js and MongoDB.

    - It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, 
    and is used to translate between objects in code and 
    the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

    - Mongoose makes it easier to work with MongoDB in Node.js 
    by providing a higher-level abstraction layer.

/*
    Why Mongoose?
  
    - Simplifies working with MongoDB: Mongoose provides an 
    easy-to-use API that simplifies many common tasks when 
    working with MongoDB, such as querying and updating data
    
    - Schema definition: Mongoose allows you to define a schema 
    for your data, which can help enforce consistency 
    and reduce errors.
    
    - Validation: Mongoose provides built-in validation for 
    your data, allowing you to ensure that incoming data meets 
    certain requirements before saving it to the database.
    
    - Middleware support: Mongoose supports middleware functions, 
    allowing you to hook into certain events in the data lifecycle 
    and perform custom logic.
    
    - & countless others things...
